My New Year's resolution for Formal Flamingo was to give our brand a more modern look and website. The original website was a static HTML site and was very fast but not very practical when it came to updating and scaling up. That is why we decided to look into Gatsby, a static site generator built on Javascript, to give us some of the features that we are looking for without having to sacrifice speed and control by going with a more opinionated platform like Wordpress.

###Under the Hood

The main technical upgrade to this website is it is moving from being a simple static website to a Gatsby website. This leaves us with a super-fast website that also gives us a ton of out of the box features that save a ton of time. Things like sitemaps, caching, meta tags, and new blog posts are just a few things that generate themselves now we have made the switch


###Design Choices

This is what our website looked like before. It is the second generation of this site but it is still pretty early in our business's infancy. One of the main things that we wanted to address was to make it look more modern and clean. Going with more whitespace and making the colors a little less dark and adding some custom and open-source illustrations are a few ways that we have made our site better to look at. We also designed it with the intent to add a dark mode for increased user experience some so we got rid of the black in our original design. 


###Hosting

Switching to an SSG, static site generator, gave us more options for hosting. We were on a shared Hostgator account that was good but now we have moved this site to Netlify to take advantage of their pushed builds and CDN's. 
Every time we make a change it is pushed to Github and the web site updates automatically. It even works with a headless content management system.
CDN's, content delivery network, is a faster way to serve the site that takes where the user is located into account to make the already fast site load faster. 

###In Conclusion
It was a bit of a learning curve but our new site id up and running. New features and content on the way. 

Here it is on Github so you can take a look at the code.
