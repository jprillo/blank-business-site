It can be hard to justify investing in your business's website but a good website can more than pay for itself where a bad one isn't free and does nothing. 
The most common advice I could find in a google search is to address your website every 2-3 years.  That sounds about right according to these reasons for a new website. Some you can avoid and some you can not.

###Broken website.	

It could be a few links or the entire thing but having things on your website that doesn't work is a bummer. Isn't the best first impression on a potential customer. 

###Your website is slow. 			

If your website takes a long time to load then users will go elsewhere. You want your potential customers to get what they want as fast as possible. It also helps in getting your site indexed well on search engines. 

###The business has changed 										
Have things about your business changed in a way that could be better represented on a new website? Maybe your branding has changed. Make sure your website represents your business as it is today.

###Not designed for Phones									 
Most users are going to access your website with their phone. Make sure it isn't hard to read.  

###Improve user-experience 										
A phone button that calls your store, a scrollable menu, captioned images, blogs, and galleries are just some ways to make the website better for your users. Check and see if your website is making use of the latest trends in web development to give your users a better experience.

###Not ranking well																	
This could be caused by a ton of different reasons including some of the ones mentioned above. Having a site that is optimized correctly for the search engine is the best way to get a leg up on your search engine ranking.
