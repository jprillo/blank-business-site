  Formal Flamingo Web Design
</h1>

Formal Flamingo is the name of the web deign agency I run with my wife. I am redesigning and developing our website on Gatsby to get a leg up on our competition. Flamingo's stand on one leg. I know kinda corny but we have been doing alright and it is time to up our game. 

We are building this on top of the Gatsby starter blog and will be deployed through netlify.
